# Introduction ðŸ“Œ
This project is a CLI-based user friendly interface to [Hooverfarm's YBA script](https://discord.gg/TeP8KS8Tff).


# Usage ðŸ“Œ
Currently it officially supports Syanpse, Krnl and Scriptware, because it relies on the way their folders are in place (However feel free to test it on other executors, if you run into problems open an [issue](https://github.com/system69-e/hooverfarm-thing/issues)).  

Simply put the provided binary in your `workspace` folder and run it.

## How to use Autorestart
1. Download the provided .exe file from [Releases](https://github.com/system69-e/hooverfarm-thing/releases)  
2. Move the downloaded file to your workspace folder
3. When you run the file for the first time and choose the second option, a new text file will be created for you called `cookie`  
4. You will need to get your [.ROBLOSECURITY token by following this guide](https://ro.py.jmk.gg/dev/roblosecurity/) (you can also look it up on Youtube), and paste it in the file
5. Run the .exe file file again, select Autorestart, input a time in minutes, Enjoy.
